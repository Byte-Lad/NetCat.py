# NetCat.py

This is one of my small projects built with Python’s socket library.
The goal of this script is to demonstrate how the Netcat tool works under the hood, as a practical exercise for learning network programming.

Feel free to modify or improve it — just let me know about any major changes or ideas you implement.

Thanks for checking out this project!
